# AboutMe
My first repository, and general info about me.

Hello! I'm LupisDragon, or Ian irl. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I enjoy learning about all types of stuff, but have always been good at math, science, and technology. I like to say that I'm normally strange, and strangely normal. I enjoy playing all kinda of games, whether they be video games, board games, or card games, plus kayaking and occasionally having fun creating music. 

I'm sure I could add more, but that's it for now. Thanks for reading!
